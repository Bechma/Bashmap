# Bashmap

Behold the fastest and error proof nmap, everything is writen in bash, so no dependencies, no extra libraries, no extrashit.

You would not believe how easy is to use, just:

```bash
bash bashmap.sh <IP>
```

And it will scan all the ports for a given IP, making it the best tool for a stealthy red team or covered operation.

# DISCLAIMER

With great power comes great responsibility. You can easily turn down(for what) servers and corporations when it's used in a DDoS environment.
The owner(me) does not take any responsibility for the misuse of bashmap, the only responsibility of the owner is to laugh at you if they take you to jail due to an idiot behaviour.
